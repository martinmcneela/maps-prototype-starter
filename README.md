# Maps starter (for prototyping)

## Overview
This is a super simple OpenLayers/typescript app that hits the correct map servers and loads a map onto the screen in 27700 projection.

## Running it
*You will need to set the environment variables for TILE_SERVER_URL and STAGE_TOKEN for the map to load, the easiest way will be to add a `.env.local` file*

- clone the repo and cd into it
- run `yarn` to install the dependencies
- run `yarn start` to run the app, it will open on http://localhost:1234 by default
